//! A handwritten parser for our arguments.
//!
//! We don't currently use a 3rd party library like clap for a few reasons. Firstly, we need to
//! support flags like `--push-state` and `--pop-state`. These need to push and pop a state stack
//! when they're parsed. Some of the other flags then need to manipulate the state of the top of the
//! stack. Positional arguments like input files and libraries to link, then need to have the
//! current state of the stack attached to that file.
//!
//! Secondly, long arguments need to also be accepted with a single '-' in addition to the more
//! common double-dash.
//!
//! Basically, we need to be able to parse arguments in the same way as the other linkers on the
//! platform that we're targeting.
