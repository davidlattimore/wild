// This test checks that we correctly handle the .init and .fini sections. These section is a bit
// different to other sections in that glibc defines the start of the _init function in one file
// (crti.o) and then any other objects that define code for the .init section need to appear after
// this with no padding in between. The end of the function is then from crtn.o which has the return
// instruction. Of these .init sections, the only one with alignment >1 is the start of the
// function. This is tricky for us since normally we pad all sections to a multiple of their
// alignment. We can't do that here because then we'd end up with zero bytes in the middle of our
// _init function.
