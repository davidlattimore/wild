# WASM Linker — Known Gaps and TODOs

Status: 66 of 222 LLD tests passing (30%), 67 with `--include-ignored` (30%).

Reference: [tool-conventions/Linking.md](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/blob/main/Linking.md).

## Implemented

### Core linking

- §2: 27 of 27 `R_WASM_*` relocation types handled
- §4.2: Symbol flags `BINDING_WEAK`, `UNDEFINED`, `EXPORTED`, `NO_STRIP`,
  `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN`
- §4.3: Import name resolution for unnamed undefined symbols
- §5: `WASM_SEGMENT_INFO` (alignment, names, TLS flags on segments)
- §6: `WASM_INIT_FUNCS` + `.init_array` constructor registration
- §7: COMDAT dedup — symbol-level via generic pipeline, losing data/function
  segments skipped on link
- §9.1: Section merging (type dedup, function, code, data, global)
- §9.2: Symbol resolution (strong/weak, entry point, `--export` flags)
- §9.4 (partial): Relocation application for the 11 supported types
- §9.5: Padded LEB128 patching
- §9.6: Output section ordering

### Memory layout

- `--stack-first` (default) / `--no-stack-first`
- `--initial-memory`, `--max-memory`, `--global-base`, `--no-growable-memory`
- `--initial-heap` (with correct u64 page calculation)
- Segment merging by name prefix (`.rodata.*` / `.data.*` / `.bss.*` grouping)
- Per-group output segments with group-aligned layout
- Name-based BSS classification (not content-based)
- `__heap_base` aligned to max data segment alignment

### Exports and globals

- `--export-dynamic` / `--export-all` (with `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN` filtering)
- `--export=<sym>` resolves both functions and globals
- `--export-table`, `--import-table`, `--growable-table`
- Export ordering: memory → globals → functions → table
- Linker-defined globals: `__stack_pointer`, `__data_end`, `__heap_base`,
  `__global_base`, `__rodata_start`, `__rodata_end`

### Code generation

- `__wasm_call_ctors` synthesis (before relocation pass for correct refs)
- Function-level GC with opcode-aware reachability scanner
- `--compress-relocations` via `wilt` pass (opcode-aware LEB128 compression)
- Custom section ordering (user → name → target_features) and concatenation

### Other

- Output validation (section order, function/code count, export indices,
  import accounting)
- Archives (via wild's generic pipeline)
- Name section (function names + global names)
- Bounds-safe padded LEB128, overflow-safe memory calculation
- Test runner: split-file, `%/t` substitution, `KNOWN_PASSING` lists

## Gaps

### High severity

- **Relocation coverage at 27/27.** Unhandled types still emit a
  deduplicated `tracing::warn!` if anything exotic appears.

  Caveats on the just-landed variants:

  - EH tag support now resolves kind-4 (`SYMTAB_EVENT`) symbols by
    name with §9.2 strong/weak rules and §7 COMDAT (kind 3) dedup,
    mirroring the function-merge pipeline. Hidden-visibility tags
    are filtered from `--export-dynamic` and `WASM_SYM_EXPORTED`
    tags emit kind-0x04 exports. `R_WASM_TAG_INDEX_LEB` (10)
    patches through the resolved output index. Still unmodelled:
    tag names in the name section, and full EH semantics
    (`throw`/`catch`/`delegate` validation, unwinding).
  - PIC-relative relocs (11/12/17/24) currently degrade to their
    non-REL siblings on the assumption of non-PIC output
    (`__memory_base = __table_base = 0`). When the PIC pipeline
    lands they need to switch to base-relative arithmetic.
  - Memory64 has a working end-to-end path: `--features=+memory64`
    / `-mwasm64` / `--target=wasm64-*` flip `args.memory64`, memory
    imports and memory sections carry the 0x04 limits bit with
    ULEB64 page counts, the eight address-typed linker-synth globals
    widen to i64 (imported `__memory_base` / `__stack_pointer`
    included under PIC), and active data-segment offsets emit as
    `i64.const` with SLEB64 payloads. Internal address arithmetic
    stays `u32` by default; the `wasm-addr64` Cargo feature switches
    the `Addr` type alias to `u64` for layouts above 4 GiB. Still to
    do: a real mem64 `.s` test in the LLD-style suite, bulk-memory
    operand widths beyond `memory.init`, and memory64 PIC (the
    REL_SLEB relocs still degrade to their non-REL forms under
    `__memory_base = 0`).
- **Exception handling** blocked — `SYMTAB_EVENT` (kind 4) and
  `R_WASM_EVENT_INDEX_LEB` are stubs; EH tags unparsed.
- **§8 target-features merging**: implemented in
  `merge_target_features`. `+` (0x2b, USED) and legacy `=` (0x3d,
  REQUIRED) unify into USED; `-` (0x2d, DISALLOWED) survives only
  when no input uses the feature; the USED-vs-DISALLOWED conflict
  case errors out. The spec §8 shared-memory/`atomics` guardrail
  also fires when `--shared-memory` is combined with any input
  listing `-atomics`. Covered by six unit tests.

### Medium severity

- **Relocatable output (`-r`) is lossy.** Type dedup, function merge,
  imports, linking section with symtab + segment info, and custom sections
  work, but relocation sections and COMDAT group records are omitted.
  Downstream linkers see a degraded object.
- **PIC / shared libraries are partially wired.**
  - `-pie`, `--pie`, `--experimental-pic` now set `WasmArgs.is_pic`
    (previously silently ignored).
  - Element segment init expression uses `global.get __table_base`
    under PIC (previously always `i32.const 1`, overriding the
    dynamic linker's runtime base).
  - Data segment init expression uses `global.get __memory_base`
    under `is_shared`.
  - Remaining gaps:
    - `WASM_DYLINK_NEEDED` subsection hardcoded empty
      (`wasm_writer.rs:95`); no `DYLINK_EXPORT_INFO` or
      `DYLINK_IMPORT_INFO`.
    - `@GOT` symbol pipeline: partial. Static/PIE links now
      internalise `GOT.func.<sym>` as a local immutable i32 global
      with init = target's indirect-table slot, and `GOT.mem.<sym>`
      with init = target's memory address. Shared output still
      passes these through. Unit test
      `got_func_import_parses_with_field_name` pins the parse path.
      Still missing end-to-end: debug-section relocations against
      linker globals expect `0xFFFFFFFF` sentinel when unresolved
      (pic-static-unused), and pic-static expects a specific
      global-section byte pattern for internalised GOTs — closing
      the gap to those tests needs both the 0xFFFFFFFF convention
      and a matching expected-output audit.
    - `@TBREL` / `@MBREL` static behaviour: under static link the
      compiler's `global.get __table_base` / `__memory_base`
      sequences either need the base globals synthesised as local
      immutable i32 globals (init = 1 / 0) or the SLEB values
      pre-adjusted so the `i32.add` comes out absolute. Wild does
      neither today; the existing REL_SLEB handler just writes the
      absolute address and relies on `global.get` returning 0.
    - `_is_pic` alone (without `is_shared`) doesn't yet propagate
      to the "import `__memory_base` / `__table_base` /
      `__stack_pointer`" machinery — a pure `-pie` link today
      falls back to the static code path. Unifying the two
      requires a careful pass over the ~12 `is_shared` gates in
      the writer.
    - `R_WASM_MEMORY_ADDR_LOCREL_I32` in code sections (currently
      handled for data-section relocs only).
- **Symbol kinds `SYMTAB_SECTION` (3) and `SYMTAB_TABLE` (5)
  unimplemented.** Multi-table and section-symbol relocations degrade.
- **Shared memory / atomics.** `--shared-memory` flag exists but
  passive-segment synthesis and `__wasm_init_memory` are stub-level.
  Thread-model object files don't link correctly.
- **TLS (§10) not implemented.** `__tls_size`, `__tls_align`, `__tls_base`,
  `__wasm_init_tls` are neither synthesised nor exported.

### Low severity

- **Symbol-flag plumbing is incomplete** — `EXPLICIT_NAME (0x40)`,
  `TLS (0x100)`, `ABSOLUTE (0x200)` are parsed (or missing entirely for
  ABSOLUTE) but not round-tripped to the output symbol table.
- **LTO / bitcode** input processing — unimplemented.
- **Debug info** beyond pass-through — DWARF rewriting and
  name-section demangling unimplemented; `.debug_*` sections flow through
  verbatim even when sections would need rebasing.
- `.import_module` / `.import_name` custom import attributes —
  unimplemented.
- `--export-memory=<name>` — unimplemented.
- `--keep-section`, `--Map`, `--build-id`, `--reproduce`,
  `-wrap`/`--wrap` — unimplemented.
- **Weak-undefined resolution** — weak refs to undefined symbols should
  resolve to 0; wild currently errors.
- **Signature-mismatch diagnostics** — type mismatches between
  declarations and definitions not warned.
- **Segment merging by name prefix** is *more* aggressive than the spec
  requires; compatible but non-standard.
- **Init-function priority uniqueness** unchecked (§9.6; probably harmless).
- **User-defined globals**: core path works (parse GLOBAL section, emit
  with correct valtype init exprs, resolve `R_WASM_GLOBAL_INDEX_LEB`,
  immutable-first ordering). Remaining: export data-symbol addresses as
  globals, mutable-global export gating, empty-name symbol pipeline fix.

### Pipeline integration

The wasm writer still re-parses raw binary input rather than fully
leveraging wild's generic pipeline. Longer-term improvements:

- Use `layout.symbol_resolutions` for symbol→address mapping
- Move relocation application into the generic writer framework
- Use pipeline section layout for memory offset assignment

## Implemented but untested

Features landed in code with no dedicated test in wild's wasm suite.
Priority candidates for follow-up test cases. Each line names the
shipping commit (where applicable) and what would need to be exercised.

### Relocation handlers

- `R_WASM_GLOBAL_INDEX_I32` (13), `TABLE_NUMBER_LEB` (20),
  `FUNCTION_INDEX_I32` (26) — `bbfae0a`. Need a `.s` or `.ll` test
  that emits each and checks the patched bytes.
- `R_WASM_MEMORY_ADDR_LEB64` (14), `SLEB64` (15), `I64` (16) —
  `87bf606`. Need a memory64 object exercising each width.
- `R_WASM_TABLE_INDEX_SLEB64` (18), `I64` (19),
  `FUNCTION_OFFSET_I64` (22) — `87bf606`. Same memory64 dependency.
- `R_WASM_MEMORY_ADDR_REL_SLEB` (11), `TABLE_INDEX_REL_SLEB` (12),
  `MEMORY_ADDR_REL_SLEB64` (17), `MEMORY_ADDR_LOCREL_I32` (23),
  `TABLE_INDEX_REL_SLEB64` (24), `MEMORY_ADDR_TLS_SLEB64` (25) —
  `09bde02`. PIC / memory64 / TLS paths.
- `R_WASM_TAG_INDEX_LEB` (10) — `f4ca707` + `53bdad4`. Need an EH
  object with a tag ref.

### EH / tag pipeline

- Tag section (id 13) parse → emit round-trip has a unit test in
  `wasm_writer::tests::tag_section_parse_roundtrip` covering type
  section, kind-0x04 import, and local tag def.
- Still uncovered: kind-4 (`SYMTAB_EVENT`) symbol merging with §9.2
  strong/weak, §7 COMDAT (kind 3) dedup, hidden-visibility
  filtering, and kind-0x04 export emission under
  `--export-dynamic`. Needs a multi-object end-to-end test.

### LEB / SLEB writers

- `write_padded_leb128`, `write_padded_sleb128`,
  `write_padded_leb128_u64`, `write_padded_sleb128_i64` all have
  unit tests in `wasm_writer::tests` covering 0, 1, -1, boundary
  powers of two, and type MIN/MAX.

### Writer and validator plumbing

- Unhandled-reloc `tracing::warn!` dedup — `9b4ba5f`. A targeted test
  that feeds an unknown reloc type and checks the warning fires once.
- Section-order validator using *logical* positions (datacount and
  tag) — covered by the existing output format but the ordering rule
  itself has no negative test.
- Tidy CRLF exemption for `wild/tests/lld-wasm/Inputs/libstub.so` —
  `255160b`. Relies on the `.gitattributes` entry staying put; a
  test asserting both file contents and attribute would catch
  accidental removal.

## Test suite skips — mapping to gaps

The `KNOWN_PASSING` allow-list in `wild/tests/lld_wasm_tests.rs` skips
categories that each map back to a gap above:

- multi-table / table manipulation → symbol kind `TABLE`, reloc 20
- `.import_module` / `.import_name` → custom attributes gap
- name-section demangling → debug info gap
- LTO / bitcode → LTO gap
- weak aliases → symbol flag plumbing gap
- DWARF debug info → debug info gap
- weak-undefined resolution → low-severity gap above
