# Wild linker

Wild is a linker with the goal of being very fast for iterative development.

It's still very much a work-in-progress and definitely shouldn't be used for linking any production
binaries.

## Q&A

### Why another linker?

Mold is already very fast, however it doesn't do incremental linking and the author has stated that
they don't intend to. Wild doesn't do incremental linking yet, but that is the end-goal. By writing
Wild in Rust, it's hoped that the complexity of incremental linking will be achievable.

### What's working?

The following platforms / architectures are currently supported:

* x86-64 on Linux

The following is working with the caveat that there may be bugs:

* Output to statically linked, non-relocatable binaries
* Output to statically linked, position-independent binaries (static-PIE)
* Output to dynamically linked binaries
* Output to shared objects (.so files)
* Rust proc-macros, when linked with Wild work
* Most of the top downloaded crates on crates.io have been tested with Wild and pass their tests
* Debug info

### What isn't yet supported?

Lots of stuff. Here are some of the larger things that aren't yet done, roughly sorted by current
priority:

* Incremental linking
* Support for architectures other than x86-64
* Support for a wider range of linker flags
* Linker scripts
* Mac support
* Windows support
* LTO

### How can I verify that Wild was used to link a binary?

Install `readelf`, then run:

```sh
readelf  -p .comment my-executable
```

Look for a line like:

```
Linker: Wild version 0.1.0
```

Or if you don't want to install readelf, you can probably get away with:

```sh
strings my-executable | grep Linker
```

### Where did the name come from?

It's somewhat of a tradition for linkers to end with the letters "ld". e.g. "GNU ld, "gold", "lld",
"mold". Since the end-goal is for the linker to be incremental, an "I" is added. Let's say the "W"
stands for "Wild", since recursive acronyms are popular in open-source projects.

## Benchmarks

There are lots of features that Wild doesn't yet support, so I'm not sure benchmarking is super
useful at this stage. That said, I have done some very preliminary comparisons. I've tried linking
the binary in my [warm build benchmark repository](https://github.com/davidlattimore/warm-build-benchmark), which builds
an ~80MB, non-PIE,
statically linked binary with symbol tables, eh-frames and no debug info. On my laptop, I get the
following times:

| Linker | Time (ms) | Â± Standard deviation (ms) | CPU time (ms) | File size (MiB) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| GNU ld | 12300     | 150                       | 12299         | 80.3            |
| gold   | 3365      | 30                        | 3362          | 83.3            |
| lld    | 905       | 5.6                       | 1222          | 84.8            |
| mold   | 457       | 7.2                       | 2834          | 81.1            |
| wild   | 363       | 6.6                       | 1585          | 80.9            |

Notes about these results:

* CPU time is user + system CPU time as reported by hyperfine.
* Mold by default forks, which lets the user not wait for the mold process that does the work to
  shut down. This is a neat optimisation. In the above benchmarks, the time column is with this
  optimisation enabled. The CPU time however is with this optimisation disabled (--no-fork), since
  when forking is enabled, we can't easily measure the CPU time.

All we can really conclude from this benchmark is that Wild is currently reasonably efficient at
non-incremental linking and reasonable at taking advantage of a few threads. I don't think that
adding the missing features should change this benchmark significantly. i.e. adding support for
debug info really shouldn't change our speed when linking with no debug info. I can't be sure
however until I implement these missing features.

See [BENCHMARKING.md](BENCHMARKING.md) for more details on benchmarking.

## Linking Rust code

The following is a `cargo test` command-line that can be used to build and test a crate using Wild.
This has been run successfully on a few popular crates (e.g. ripgrep, serde, tokio, rand, bitflags).
It assumes that the "wild" binary is on your path. It also depends on the Clang compiler being
installed, since GCC doesn't allow using an arbitrary linker.

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-Clinker=clang -Clink-args=--ld-path=wild" cargo test
```
