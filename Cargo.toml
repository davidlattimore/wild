# Sure, less arguments is good, but it's a trade-off. Sometimes you have a complex function that
# you'd like to split by extracting part of it out into a new function. That new function might
# have lots of arguments. It might be possible to group some of those arguments together into some
# new struct, but not always. Given the choice between a function that's too large and does too
# much vs a function that has too many arguments, it's sometimes best to pick the latter.
# Especially since that function is generally only ever called from one place and the arguments all
# have distinct types.
